* Some typograhic conventions may seem inconsistent.

I use italic for:
- emphasis (\emph)
- foreign words, terms or phrases (personal command \alien)
- metalingusitic mentions (personal command \sicut)

I use French quotes (guillemets « ») for:
- scare quotes
- quotations (theoretically, as the book doesn't contain much quotations, and I also use the 'quote' environnement)
- metalingusitic mentions

So there's a competion between italic and quotes for mentions.  Roughly, my rule of thumb is: italic is for isolated words or short phrases, quotes are for sentences; so variations may occur in borderline cases ("not so short" phrases).


* According to some French typographic conventions,  latin phrases that have passed into the commun usage (a priori, a posteriori, ex æquo...) need not to be italicized.
